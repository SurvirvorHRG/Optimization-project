## Aim:

- Formulate the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) regression model as a Quadratic Program
- Derive mathematically and implement the loss and gradients of the Huber model
- Implement your own solvers for L1 or squared L2 regularization with: (Accelerated) Proximal gradient descent, Proximal coordinate descent and L-BFGS (only for L2).
- Implement your own scikit-learn estimator for the Huber model and test it against the Ridge and Lasso from scikit-learn on some real data.
- You are expected to provide clear figures as one could expect from an experiment section in a research paper.
